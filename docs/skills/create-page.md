# Create Page Skill

## How To Use

This file is not meant to be copied into the prompt.

It is meant to be referenced directly, for example:

```md
[create-page.md](docs/skills/create-page.md)

About Us

Required sections:
- hero: with image, description, title, button_url, and button_label
- values: grid of 4 cards with icon, title, and description
```

When this file is referenced, the agent should treat the rest of the user's message as the page specification to implement.

## Instruction For The Agent

If this file was referenced in the prompt:

1. Use these canonical documents as the source of truth:
   - [pages-guide.md](../pages-guide.md): rules specific to the Page entity
   - [content-model.md](../content-model.md): canonical shape of structured content
   - [templates.md](../templates.md): template registration and rendering
   - [live-editor.md](../live-editor.md): shared editor and preview contract
   - [image-strategy.md](../image-strategy.md): image and media handling
   - [seo-guide.md](../seo-guide.md): SEO and sitemap compatibility for public pages
2. Treat all text after the reference to this file as the functional requirement.
3. If the user gives a name such as `About Us`, infer a reasonable slug if none is explicitly provided.
4. If a new template is needed, register it and create it.
5. If a section can reuse a key already compatible with another template, reuse it; otherwise define a new one with clear, stable names.
6. Add a section editor partial when a section needs fields beyond the generic `heading` and `body` fallback.
7. Do not hardcode editable content in Blade.
8. For images, use media IDs or the media strategy required by the current architecture.
9. Keep the content aligned with the `meta` + `sections` contract.
10. If the page needs to be ready for editing, respect the shared editor contract.
11. If the request is ambiguous, make the smallest reasonable interpretation consistent with the existing architecture.

- page name
- slug, if a specific one is required

- whether a new template is needed or an existing one should be reused
