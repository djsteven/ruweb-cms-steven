# Maintenance Commands

## Purpose

This document lists recurring operational commands and how to think about their use.

It should stay focused on maintenance workflows, not implementation history.

## Typical Maintenance Areas

- email delivery verification
- credential recovery or password reset
- orphaned media auditing
- image optimization and variant generation
- media health auditing

Initial project setup is handled by `php artisan cms:install`. This guide focuses on recurring operational commands after installation.

## Send A Test Email

```bash
php artisan mail:test {email}
```

Use this to verify outbound email configuration without going through the admin UI.

## Reset A User Password

```bash
php artisan cms:user:reset-password {email?}
```

Use this when an administrator or editor needs a controlled password reset from the command line.

## Audit Orphaned Media

```bash
php artisan cms:media:audit-orphans
```

Use this to find media records that are no longer referenced by the application.

If the command supports deletion, review output carefully before using destructive flags such as `--delete`.

## Image Optimization Workflow

Typical sequence:

```bash
php artisan media:convert-webp
php artisan media:generate-variants
```

Guideline:

- run sequentially, not in parallel

Useful options may include:

- `--dry-run`
- `--force`

## Audit Media Health

```bash
php artisan media:audit-health
```

Use this to compare database state and physical storage state for media assets.

## Operational Guidance

- prefer dry-run modes when available
- review output before destructive operations
- document environment-specific differences outside this file

## Scope Boundary

This document should not become:

- a deployment guide
- a troubleshooting log for one environment
- a changelog of when commands were introduced
